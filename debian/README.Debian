libndn for Debian
----------------

We package this as having soname 0, that said libndn is changing fast, and
it's dependencies use it's full version a.b.c as a soname for that. this
makes it impractical for debian packaging as it requires to make a lot of
new binary packagesâ€¦ (and that there is no easy way to generate them), so we
force a soname of 0 and require a source version hard dependency on the
other packages, this is not ideal but it looks like the best we can do now.
